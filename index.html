			<h4>Research Interests</h4>
			<p>Bayesian nonparametrics and data confidentiality. My research focuses on proposing, 
				studying, and applying Bayesian nonParametric models for single/regression 
				density estimation and hypothesis testing. In addition, 
				I work with Professor <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/">Jerry Reiter</a> 
				on differential private verification measures and statistical methods 
				for generating synthetic data using nonparametric models. 
				My work has involved interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection of statistics, 
				computer science, political science, environmental engineering, and psychometrics.</p>
