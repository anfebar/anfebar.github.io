			<h3>Research Interests</h3>
			<p>Bayesian Non-parametrics and Data Confidentiality. My research focuses on proposing, studying, and applying Bayesian Non-Parametric models for single/regression density estimation and hypothesis testing. In addition, I work with Professor <li><a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/">Jerry Reiter</a></li> on differential private verification measures and statistical methods for generating synthetic data using non-parametric models. My work has involved interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection of statistics, computer science, political science, and psychometrics.</p>
