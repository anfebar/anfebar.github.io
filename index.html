			<p>I am  an assistant professor in the <a href="https://stat.fsu.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at 
<a href="https://www.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a>. My research interests focus on developing and studying methodological procedures 
				in statistical science that incorporate flexible Bayesian modeling and approaches 
				for data privacy.  My methodological research involves single and regression density 
				estimation, hypothesis testing, massive data, probabilistic approaches for complex data, 
				differentially private procedures, and synthetic data generators.  </p>
