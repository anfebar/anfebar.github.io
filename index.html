			<p>Bayesian Non-parametrics and Data Confidentiality. My research focuses on proposing, studying, and applying Bayesian Non-Parametric models for a random probability measure and for families of predictor-dependent probability measures. In addition, I work with Professor Jerry Reiter on differential private verification measures and statistical methods for generating synthetic data using non-parametric models. My work has involved interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection of statistics, computer science, political science, and psychometrics.</p>
