			<h4>Research Interests</h4>
			<p>Bayesian nonparametrics and data privacy. My research focuses on proposing, 
				studying, and applying Bayesian nonparametric models for single and regression 
				density estimation, hypothesis testing, massive data, and imputation of erroneous and missing values. 
				In addition, I work with Professor <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/">Jerry Reiter</a> 
				on developing differentially private procedures and synthetic data generators based on 
				nonparametric approaches. My work has involved interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection 
				of statistics, computer science, political science, environmental engineering, and psychometrics.</p>
